Hi there!

I am a data science and analytics professional, continually enhancing my skills through various projects. Below are some key projects I have worked on, showcasing my proficiency in different data science techniques and tools.
Music Streaming Analysis (SoundCloud)

Objective: Analyze user activity data from SoundCloud to understand listening patterns.

Task: Create a NoSQL database for data analysis, focusing on identifying trends in user behavior and popular songs.

Red Wine Quality Analysis

Objective: Determine the best indicators of red wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

Approach: Utilize multi-linear regression to predict wine quality. The project involved analyzing variables such as acidity, pH level, sugar, and other chemical properties.

Data: Sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the dataset included numerical values for various physicochemical tests.

Iris Dataset Analysis

Objective: Accurately predict the class of iris plants based on feature measurements.

Approach: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, encode the target variable, and experiment with different training-validation-test ratios. Implement KFold Cross Validation and Grid Search to optimize model performance. Analyze the results using precision, recall, accuracy, and latency.

IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Objective: Predict the sentiment (positive or negative) in movie reviews.

Dataset: Comprising 25,000 movie reviews with binary sentiment classification.

Approach: Preprocess text data by removing punctuation, performing tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing/stemming. Perform TFIDF vectorization and explore parameter settings using GridSearchCV on Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifiers. Evaluate models using various metrics to report the best performing model.

Wholesale Customer Segmentation

Objective: Describe the variation in different types of customers for a wholesale distributor.

Approach: Perform EDA and data cleaning, implement feature scaling, and use RFECV to find the optimal number of features. Apply KMeans clustering to identify the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. Implement PCA to understand the variance explained by the first few components and visualize the clusters. Use XGBoost Classifier with 5-fold cross-validation to report performance metrics.
